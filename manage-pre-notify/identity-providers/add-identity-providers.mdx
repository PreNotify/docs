Identity providers allow your users to log into PreNotify using their existing accounts from external identity systems like Microsoft Entra. Instead of creating separate local accounts, users can authenticate with their familiar work or personal credentials.

## Supported Identity Providers

These providers can be used to connect and log in to PreNotify:

- Microsoft Entra ID

### Microsoft Entra ID

Integrate with Microsoft’s enterprise identity platform to allow users to authenticate using their Microsoft Entra ID Directory accounts. Ideal for organizations using Microsoft 365 or other Azure services, providing seamless single sign-on across your Microsoft ecosystem.
